/**
 * Roborazzi tests for recipe management scenarios as requested in GitHub issue #500.
 *
 * These tests cover the following scenarios:
 * 1. Deleting an existing recipe
 * 2. Starting a new recipe but aborting by clicking "delete" button
 * 3. Starting a new recipe but navigating "back"
 * 4. Complex login/logout/delete/login flows with server sync
 * 5. Creating a recipe then logging in for server synchronization
 *
 * Tests use Robolectric/Roborazzi and run in the JVM with fake web server.
